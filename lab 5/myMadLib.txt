Hello professor,
I am <emotion> to inform you, but my pet <animal> has eating my homework.
I know it sounds <adjective>, especially consider that this is the <number> time this week that this happened. 
However, <pets name> seems to believe that my homework has a similar taste to their favorite food, <type of food>.
And when I <senses> them eating my homework I was so <emotions (2)> that I just sat there and watched.
<Family members name> had been there too but was simply too perplexed by the situation unfolding to do anything about it.
All in all, I know that this is surprising, especially since my homework was on a/an <type of data storage>, but thats not that relevant to the current situation.
