Hello professor,
I am sad to inform you, but my pet cat has eating my homework.
I know it sounds ate, especially consider that this is the 5 time this week that this happened. 
However, pippa seems to believe that my homework has a similar taste to their favorite food, ravioli.
And when I smelled them eating my homework I was so supprised that I just sat there and watched.
erik had been there too but was simply too perplexed by the situation unfolding to do anything about it.
All in all, I know that this is surprising, especially since my homework was on  a/an computer, but thatâ€™s not that relevant to the current situation.
